DocSpark is an intelligent document processing and interaction application that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like LangGraph and corrective RAG (retrieval-augmented generation). It allows users to upload documents, take quizzes, get job-related information, and more. The app is designed to assist in learning, job exploration, and general inquiries.
## Features
### Library Section
- Users can upload documents (PDF or Video) and ask questions related to the content.
- The Library Bot utilizes corrective RAG to provide answers based on the uploaded documents.
### Teacher Section
- Users can request a 50-mark question paper with 5 questions (each worth 10 marks).
- After uploading their answers, the system automatically grades the responses and generates a detailed report indicating the total score.
### III Cell Section
- Users can enter the name of a job they aim for.
- The system performs a web search to show open positions for that job in India.
- Additionally, it suggests courses that could help the user excel in the desired job.
### General Bot
- Users can ask any question, and the General Bot provides responses while maintaining past conversations for context.
